# Predictive models in Category based Carsales data sets
The aim is to build predictive models to facilitate decision making for second hand car buyers and sellers. This project is implemented predictive models on actual data from Carsales second hand car sale site. Multiple Linear, Random Forest and Neural Network predictive modelling techniques were employed to create predictive models. Using real dataset from Carsales, we observe contributing features in category into different levels of prestige - luxury sports, luxury and economy cars. Moreover, we drill down car categories to discover the price influencing features on different car makes. 

1. scraping data from Carsales.com.au; it will extract data of Toyota Corolla car brand from Carsales.

2. pre-processing part from dataset; it will examine the prices of a specific car and explore the distribution of the prices. For example, evaluate the correlations between the variables, and explore the distribution of selected variables against price variables, etc.

3. build a multiple linear regression model with the selected variables; it will try at least three linear regression models to identify the optimal model and evaluate the performance of the regression model.

4. build a random decision tree model with the selected variables;  it will try at least three random decision trees regression models with different complexity parameters to obtain the optimal tree and evaluate the model performance.

5. build a neural network regression model with the selected variables; it will try at least three neural network regression models to identify the optimal model and evaluate the performance of the regression model.

6. compare the performance of the optimal regression from multiple linear, decision tree and neural network and discuss, justify the most suitable predictive model.
