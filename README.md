## Predictive models in Category based Data analysis using Carsales data sets

The aim of this project is to build predictive models to facilitate decision making for second hand car buyers and sellers. The project implemented predictive models on actual data from Carsales.com.au. Multiple Linear, Random Forest and Neural Network predictive modelling techniques were employed to create predictive models. Moreover, we drill down car categories to discover the price influencing features on different car makes. 

### Part 1. Dataset

In order to process of building predictive models, we use sample dataset of Toyota Corolla car sales. The dataset provided comprises of 37 attributes related to 1436 sold Toyota Corolla cars. Based on this dataset, the research need to develop a reliable predictive model to predict the selling price of the cars. Therefore, the target variables applicable for model is ‘Price’.
