# Predictive models in Category based Carsales data sets
The market price of a second hand car is determined by many aspects. Buyers and sellers can find an overwhelming amount of such information scattered over the internet. There is no one tool to analyse, compare, predict and visualise the important features and price of different car categories or makes. For buyers, they can know what features can expect for the price they are willing to pay for the car. For sellers, they can know how much they can receive for the car to be sold. The aim of this research is to build such predictive models to facilitate decision making for second hand car buyers and sellers. The study implemented predictive models on actual data from Carsales second hand car sale site. Multiple Linear, Random Forest and Neural Network predictive modelling techniques were employed to create predictive models. Using real dataset from Carsales, we observe contributing features in category into different levels of prestige - luxury sports, luxury and economy cars. Moreover, we drill down car categories to discover the price influencing features on different car makes. 

* using real data and modelling categories shows that the same model is not effective for all cars. 
* predictive modelling technique performance was depends on the car category and make. 
* the importance of car features change according to each car category and make.
